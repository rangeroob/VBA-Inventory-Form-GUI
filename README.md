# VBA-Inventory-Form-GUI
VBA Inventory Form GUI is a simple form written in visual basic for applications for others to use and adapt for their needs.

## Motivation
I started this little project for a former employer because they wanted to keep track of on-hand software.

## How to use
All you have to do to use the software is download the xlsm file open it up in Microsoft Office 2013/2016 enable editing and enable content then you are good to go.

## Security 
If you are more security minded you can look over the vb source that I extracted and write your own with it instead of trusting an executable on the internet.
